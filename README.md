# Candidate-1
Just another repository 
Hi,
My name is SHARON AGWAH.
I have always had an interest in Programming. Although with no academic background; I have undergone and still I'm undergoing a series of personally tutored courses.
Getting into the ANDELA FELLOWSHIP will give me an upper hand in gaining full knowledge.
Thanks for your consideration.
